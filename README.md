In this live, we will see how to do TDD with Angular by mixing E2E and unit tests

# Verifying a national insurance number via an API

The goal of this exercise is to code a form that can call an API to validate a national insurance number

HTTP calls will be mocked in order to develop the view despite the absence of a real API as well as to save unnecessary HTTP calls

# Utilities :

- Cypress for running E2E tests
- Jasmine and Karma for running unit tests
- Spectator for easier writing of unit tests

# Useful commands:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `ng serve -o` to open the application in the browser
- `json-server --watch db.json` to run json server api on the port 3000
- `ng test` to run unit tests
- `ng e2e` to run E2E tests
